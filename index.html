                        Music has always been a big part of my life. Well it's a big part of everyone's life, right?
                        I'm still old enough to remember the days where you had to buy CDs and plug them into that CD player where
                        you could plug in some super low quality heaphones. You felt cool. You could go to the CD store and select
                        whatever related CD was near the one you last picked and jam out on your way back home. This project is an 
                        homage to that nostalgia. This project will attempt to visualize the most streamed songs per country where
                        spotify is available. Discover related artists in a tree like fashion, and discover statistics on your
                        favorite songs both old and new.
